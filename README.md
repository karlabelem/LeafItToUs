Welcome to **Leaf It To Us**, an interactive visualization designed to help plant enthusiasts and curious learners explore the unique needs of different plants. Whether you're a seasoned plant parent or a beginner, this tool makes it easy to understand how plants are grouped based on their care requirements, such as light, water, and temperature.

## What is this Project About?

Taking care of plants can be tricky, especially when every plant has its own specific needs. **Leaf It To Us** simplifies this by organizing plants into a visually engaging, half-circle tree diagram. You can select attributes like "Light Requirements" or "Watering Needs" to see how plants with similar characteristics are grouped together.

By clicking on individual nodes (the circles on the tree), you'll get detailed information about each plant, including:
- Its scientific name
- A brief description of its appearance
- Images to help you recognize it
- Key care tips, such as temperature range and humidity preferences

This tool is perfect for anyone who wants to create the best environment for their leafy friends!
